This is a simulation/playable version of the Monty Hall Paradox

## Problem Overview
Imagine you are a contestant on a game show and before you are three doors. $10,000 in cash has randomly been placed behind one door. Behind the other two doors are the consolation prizes of dishwasher detergent. The game show host asks you to select a door, and you randomly pick one. However, before revealing the prize behind your door, the game show host reveals one of the other doors that contains a consolation prize. At this point, the game show host asks if you would like to stick with your original choice or to switch to the remaining door. What do you choose?
